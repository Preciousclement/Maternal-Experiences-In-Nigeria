# Understanding Maternal Experiences in Nigeria

This project simulates a realistic dataset of 5,000 Nigerian mothers to explore maternal health, pregnancy experiences, and delivery outcomes.

## üìÇ Dataset Tables
- `nigeria_maternal_demographics_5000.csv`
- `nigeria_pregnancy_experience_5000.csv`
- `nigeria_delivery_postpartum_5000.csv`

## üìä Whats in the Data?

### 1. Demographics
- Age, State, Rural/Urban, Education Level, Marital Status, Employment

### 2. Pregnancy Experience
- Number of Pregnancies, Weeks at Delivery, Antenatal Visits & Quality
- Cravings, Aversions, Moods, Symptoms

### 3. Delivery & Postpartum
- Delivery Method, Birth Complications, Support Systems
- Baby Weight, Health Condition, Access to Postnatal Care

## üöÄ How to Use
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `Maternal Experience Project Simulation.ipynb` in Jupyter
3. Use CSVs for analysis or modeling

## üîç Purpose
This dataset is for educational and exploratory use. It's fictional but statistically inspired by data from NDHS 2018 (fertility rate ~5.5, antenatal care ~60% ‚â•4 visits), WHO data (C-section rate ~2‚Äì5%), and studies on postpartum depression (~10‚Äì15% in Nigeria). 

## üõ† Built With
- Python (pandas, numpy)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Power BI

Perfect! Your README is already solid and clear. Now, for the **Power BI section**, you can include a part that:

1. Explains what you visualized.
2. Shows how users can access or replicate the visualizations.
3. Optionally links to a Power BI report if you‚Äôve published it online.



## üìä Power BI Visualizations

This project also includes **Power BI dashboards** to explore maternal health patterns and insights:

* **Demographics Dashboard** ‚Äì Visualizes age distribution, education levels, employment, and urban/rural populations.
* **Pregnancy Experience Dashboard** ‚Äì Tracks antenatal visits, pregnancy symptoms, cravings, and mood trends.
* **Delivery & Postpartum Dashboard** ‚Äì Displays delivery methods, birth complications, baby health outcomes, and support systems.

> To view the dashboards:
> 1. Open `MaternalHealthDashboard.pbix` in Power BI Desktop.
> 2. Load the CSVs files.
> 3. Interact with slicers and charts to explore different maternal health patterns.
